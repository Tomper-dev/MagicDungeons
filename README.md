This is a text-based RPG game that I have been developing. It is just in Beta version, so, if there is any bug, please let me know.

Yes, it can only be runed in a python compiler or a IDE, and I am really sorry for that (really). After a long time, I will be resuming developing this game. It will resume on
december (dk exactly the date, but its around 12/15 - 12/20. I will post an update asap.
